        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a Minecraft vore mod! Yeah, weird, I know, but you most likely wanted this if you found it. Anyway, it focuses on player interactions for the purpose of roleplays, while also integrating some fun gameplay stuff as well. The mod is currently very early in development, so most things are subject to change, including this website.</p>
        <p>Our current planned feature list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A comprehensive player vore system</li>
          <li>The ability to design your own organs</li>
          <li>CPM compatability</li>
          <li>Item vore, including effects</li>
          <li>Player Profiles displaying nicknames, pronouns, and a bio, and potentially more</li>
          <li>Custom soundscapes for organs</li>
          <li>Colorable organ blocks</li>
          <li>Holes to transfer between organs</li>
          <li>MANY consent toggles</li>
          <li>Healing vore</li>
          <li>A struggle system</li>
          <li>Lockable kinky trinkets</li>
          <li>Mob Preds (including relevant consent toggles)</li>
          <li>Figura integration</li>
          <li>Multiple organ hole spawn points</li>
          <li>Global digestion message toggles</li>
        </ul>
